  description: The best way to drink whiskey neat is out of a lowball cocktail glass at room temperature. Two ounces is the correct serving size for this drink but bartenders shouldnâ€™t use a jigger or other measuring tool for this drink. The goal of a drink served neat is to go straight from the bottle to the glass with as little interruption as possible.
